        Rabbits are <strong>small mammals</strong> known for their <em>soft fur</em>, long ears, and short, fluffy tails. They are herbivores, feeding
        mostly on <u>hay, grass</u>, and <em>leafy vegetables</em>. With their powerful back legs, rabbits can hop quickly and cover surprising
        distances. In the wild, they often live in burrows and are most active at <em>dawn and dusk</em>. Domestic rabbits are usually <u>gentle and
        quiet,</u> making them <strong><em>great companions</em></strong> for families. With proper care, they can live up to <u><strong>10 years or
        more</strong></u>. Rabbits also groom themselves frequently and enjoy having space to explore. Because of their <strong>curious nature</strong>
        and calm temperament, they are <u>considered</u> <strong><em>ideal pets</em></strong> for those who can give them time and attention.
        </p>
    
    <p id="basic-info-text-2">
        Rabbits have excellent hearing and can rotate their long ears to detect sounds from different directions. This helps them stay alert in the
        wild and avoid predators. Their teeth never stop growing, so they need to chew on hay or wood to keep them at a healthy length. Rabbits are
        <u><em>highly social animals</em></u> and often thrive best when kept in pairs. They communicate through body language, such as thumping their
        feet or flicking their ears, to show fear or excitement. A rabbit that lies down with its legs stretched out is usually feeling <strong><u>very
        relaxed</u></strong>. If a rabbit nudges your hand or gently bumps its head against you, it may be asking for <strong><em><u>your attention or
        affection</u></em></strong>. Their behavior is often subtle but can be quite expressive once you learn to understand it. Providing a safe,
        quiet, and <u><strong>enriching environment</strong></u> is key to keeping your rabbit <em>happy and healthy</em>.

        A rabbit’s ears are not just for hearing — they also help regulate body temperature. When it’s hot, the blood vessels in their large ears help
        release excess heat. This natural cooling system is one reason rabbits thrive in many climates. Their ears can even rotate independently to
        better detect sounds from all directions, making them <u><em>very alert animals</em></u>.
        </p>
        
        <p id="basic-info-text-4">
        Rabbits have powerful hind legs built for jumping and running. In the wild, these legs allow them to escape predators quickly by darting in
        unpredictable directions. Their strong legs are also great for hopping over obstacles and digging. Domestic rabbits still have this instinct
        and may <strong>thump their feet</strong> as a warning signal when they sense danger.
        </p>
        
        <p id="basic-info-text-5">
        When rabbits feel safe and content, they may flop onto their side — a behavior known as a “bunny flop.” This action shows complete trust and
        comfort. Rabbits also perform a move called a "binky," where they jump and twist in the air. It’s their way of expressing pure joy. A rabbit
        that shows these signs is <strong><em><u>healthy, happy, and well cared for</u></em></strong>.
